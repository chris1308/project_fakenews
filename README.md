# 📰 Fake News Classification using Machine Learning (NLP + Explainability)

This project is a machine learning model that classifies news articles as **REAL or FAKE**
using **Natural Language Processing (TF-IDF)** and ML algorithms.  
It also includes **Explainable AI (XAI)** to understand why the model predicts something.
